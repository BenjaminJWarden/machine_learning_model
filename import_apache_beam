# Creating a Python virtual environment to run Apache Beam.
# Set directory.

$ cd Documents
$ pwd
# This will show the current working directory.

$ mkdir Scripting
# This will create a new directory within the directory you specified.
$ cd Scripting
$ pwd # Checking the working directory isn't necessary.
# This changes the current working directory to Scripting.

# You can check the version of Python that is installed on the machine.
$ python --version
$ pip --version
# This will install a Python virtual environment.
$ pip install --upgrade virtualenv

# This will create a virtual environment.
# You must have an active virtual environment before you install/run Apache Beam.
$ . /Users/BenjaminJWarden/Documents/Scripting/bin/activate
# This will activate your virtual environment.

# Once your virtual environment is active, you can download and install Apache Beam.
$ pip install apache-beam
# NOTE: Ensure there is enough room on your machine to download the necessary developer tools.

# From here, you will be able to begin building your data pipeline.
# There are various plugins available for Apache Beam, including GCP and AWS.

$ python -m apache_beam.examples.pythonscript --input /path/to/inputfile --output /path/to/write/counts
# NOTE: Do not immediately run the script above.
# You will need to specify a path to output the data to.


# This will create a path to run/read the script from your Python doc,
# write to an output source (again, specify the destination),
# and use Spark Runner as the runner.
$ python -m apache_beam.examples.wordcount --input /path/to/inputfile \
                                         --output /path/to/write/counts \
                                         --runner SparkRunner

# It may also be beneficial to explore VIM as an alternative virtual environment.
# Once configured, you can convert the terminal to a Python terminal by
# using the following command.
$ python 3.8
# From here, you can import any/all necessary packages for programming in the
# virtual environment using Python.
>>> exit()
# Close your Python environment and use Ruby.

$ conda list
# This will show the Anaconda packages currently installed on your machine.
$ conda env list
# This will list your Anaconda environments.

$ jupyter notebook
# This will launch Jupyter Notebook.
# From here, you can call to the directory that you specified earlier (Scripting)
# and then begin importing your Anaconda packages.
